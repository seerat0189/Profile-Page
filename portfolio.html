    <h1>Testing Tools Store Information</h1>
    <p>Testing tools store various types of information depending on their purpose. Some common types of information that testing tools store include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Test cases: These are step-by-step instructions for how to test a particular feature or functionality of an application.</li>
      <li>Test results: This includes information about whether a test passed or failed, as well as any error messages or other diagnostic information that may be relevant.</li>
      <li>Test data: This refers to any input values or other data that is used during the testing process.</li>
      <li>Performance metrics: This includes information about how well the application is performing under different conditions, such as how quickly it responds to user input or how much memory it uses.</li>
      <li>Code coverage: This refers to how much of the application's code is being tested by the testing tool.</li>
      <li>Bug reports: When a testing tool identifies a problem with the application, it will often generate a report that includes information about the bug, such as its severity, how to reproduce it, and any other relevant details.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Overall, testing tools are designed to help developers and testers identify and fix problems in software applications, and they store a wide range of information to help facilitate this process.</p>
